## Features

### JWKS Caching
The SDK now includes intelligent JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) caching to improve performance:
- **Reduced Network Requests**: JWKS is cached for 1 hour by default
- **Automatic Fallback**: If cached keys fail, automatically refresh from server
- **Better Performance**: Faster token validation with no network latency for cached JWKS
- **Backward Compatible**: No code changes required for existing implementations

For detailed information about JWKS caching, see [JWKS_CACHING.md](JWKS_CACHING.md).

npm install
```

This will automatically:
- Install PHP dependencies via Composer
