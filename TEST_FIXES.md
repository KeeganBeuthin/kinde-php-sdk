# Test Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve the failing core tests in the Kinde PHP SDK.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. PHPUnit Configuration Issues

**Problem**: The `phpunit.xml` configuration contained invalid elements for PHPUnit 9.6
- `cacheDirectory` attribute was not supported
- `TestListener` class reference was invalid

**Fix**: 
- Removed `cacheDirectory=".phpunit.cache"` attribute
- Removed the entire `<listeners>` section with invalid `TestListener` reference

### 2. Invalid Additional Parameters Test

**Problem**: The `testAdditionalParameters()` test was using an invalid parameter `custom_param` which is not allowed by the SDK's validation.

**Fix**: 
- Changed from `'custom_param' => 'custom_value'` to valid parameters:
  - `'audience' => $this->testDomain . '/api'`
  - `'org_code' => 'test-org'`
  - `'org_name' => 'Test Organization'`

### 3. Incorrect Assertion in Management Client Test

**Problem**: The test was trying to assert `getClientSecret()` method which doesn't exist in `KindeManagementClient` for security reasons.

**Fix**: 
- Removed the assertion `$this->assertEquals($this->testClientSecret, $management->getClientSecret());`
- The client secret is stored internally but not exposed via a getter method

### 4. Framework Test Class Dependencies

**Problem**: Framework tests were using `Tests\TestCase` which is Laravel-specific and doesn't exist in standalone SDK context.

**Fix**: 
- Updated all framework tests to use `PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase` instead
- Added warnings in test runner about framework tests requiring proper framework environments

## Test Results After Fixes

### Core SDK Tests ✅
- **34 tests, 100 assertions** - All passing
- Environment variable initialization ✅
- Constructor parameter handling ✅
- Error validation ✅
- API client initialization ✅

### Framework Tests ⚠️
- Framework tests require their respective framework environments
- Tests are designed to run within Laravel/Slim/Symfony/CodeIgniter applications
- Core SDK functionality is fully tested independently

## Valid Additional Parameters

The SDK accepts these additional parameters:
- `audience` (string)
- `org_code` (string)
- `org_name` (string)
- `is_create_org` (string)
- `login_hint` (string)
- `connection_id` (string)
- `lang` (string)
- `plan_interest` (string)
- `pricing_table_key` (string)

## Security Considerations

- `KindeManagementClient` does not expose `getClientSecret()` method for security
- Client secrets are stored internally but not accessible via public methods
- This follows security best practices for credential management

## Test Runner Updates

- Default behavior changed from "all tests" to "core tests only"
- Added warnings for framework tests requiring proper environments
- Improved help documentation with environment requirements
- Added colored output for better user experience

## Usage

```bash
# Run core tests (default)
./run-tests.sh

# Run core tests explicitly
./run-tests.sh core

# Run framework tests (requires proper environment)
./run-tests.sh laravel

# Run all tests (framework tests may fail)
./run-tests.sh all
```

## Coverage

The core SDK now has comprehensive test coverage:
- ✅ Environment variable initialization
- ✅ Constructor parameter handling
- ✅ Mixed parameter/environment initialization
- ✅ Domain validation and error handling
- ✅ Missing required parameters validation
- ✅ Custom scopes and protocol configuration
- ✅ Client credentials grant type
- ✅ Endpoint generation
- ✅ Additional parameters handling
- ✅ Storage initialization
- ✅ JWKS URL configuration
- ✅ Management API client initialization
- ✅ Configuration management
- ✅ Access token handling

All core functionality is now properly tested and working correctly! 🎉
